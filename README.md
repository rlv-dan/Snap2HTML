# Snap2HTML-NG

This application is a modified version of [Snap2HTML](https://github.com/rlv-dan/Snap2HTML) by RL Vision.

Snap2HTML-NG takes a "snapshot" of the folder structure on your Hard Drive or Network Drive and saves it as an HTML file. 

What's unique about Snap2HTML-NG is that the HTML file uses modern techniques to make it feel like a real File Explorer, displaying a treeview with directories that you can navigate to view the files contained within. 
There is also a built-in file search and ability to export data as plain text, CSV, or JSON. Everything is contained in a single HTML file that you can easily store or distribute.

Snap2HTML-NG file listings can be used in many ways.  An example of some is:

-   As a complement to your backups (**this is not a backup solution**). 
-	You can also keep a file list of external HDDs and other computers; in case you need to look something up or to save for historic reasons and documentation. 
-	Helping friends or family with Troubleshooting, you can ask them to send a snapshot of their directories so you can better understand their problem.

It's up to you to decide what Snap2HTML-NG can be used for!
