# Snap2HTML
This application takes a "snapshot" of the folder structure on your harddrive and saves it as an HTML file. What's unique about Snap2HTML is that the HTML file uses modern techniques to make it feel like a "real" application, displaying a treeview with folders that you can navigate to  view the files contained within. There is also a built in file search and ability to export data as plain text, csv or json. Still, everything is  contained in a single HTML file that you can easily store or distribute.
